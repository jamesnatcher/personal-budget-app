# Frontend

## General UI

- We are using Daisy UI as our main UI component builder. Default to using presets from there before building your own.
- Use tailwind classes to speed up UI creation. Then after everything is done, we may go back and consolidate similar styles.

## Icons

We are grabbing icons from [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/)

## Issues

- Currently, we have no datepicker implemented.
